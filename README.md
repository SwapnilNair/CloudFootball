### Cloud Football
A project for the Cloud Computing Course which was deployed on AWS EC2 and AWS RDS. 
- A football statistics explorer with the front interface hosted on and EC2 instance and the database on a MySQL RDs instance.( I did want to do it with PostGresQL , but it we ran over budget)
- Has an Nginx Proxy on the front for caching.
- Cool experience all in all, learning about the various platforms, connections and exposing services to to the public internet.
